### A Metaphorical approach to brand and design

****

**As a designer good communication is key to successful collaboration and progress on any project.**

Usually, the way we communicate our design is through a number of metaphors methodologies and analogies that encapsulate the complexities of our discipline. It makes it more approachable, relatable and in turn understandable for our everyone involved.

> Metaphors allow you to make the complex simple and the controversial palatable. Conversely, metaphors allow you to create extraordinary meaning out of the seemingly mundane.~ [Brian Clark][0]

Over time I have used the "mechanic" metaphor to explain why I can't estimate a project with much accuracy, as it requires further investigation and thorough evaluation. This fantastic [hiking metaphor][1] to explain project scope creep. Plus, many many more.

When it comes to my approach and process to brand and design I have delved into many different analogies---_with varying success, yet still struggling to piece everything together_. Recently, however I stumbled across [Brad Frosts][2], [Atomic Web Design][3] and although the approach is not exactly the same, the analogy was profound.

Below is the same analogy adapted, expanded and elaborated to help communicate my personal approach to both brand and design.

_It is a working version, feel free to question it, plus it or discuss it along the way._
